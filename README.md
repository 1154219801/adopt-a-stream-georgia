# Adopt-a-Stream Georgia data science projects

Local water quality impacts health, well-being, and the local economy in many ways. Data about water quality in Georgia has been collected for many years by [Adopt-a-Stream](https://adoptastream.georgia.gov/) (AaS), and is made publicly available through their [web portal](http://aas.gaepd.org). This is a great beginning to promoting public access and involvement in monitoring the impact of poor quality water on communities, and in finding causal connections between water quality outcomes and economic or political decisions about land use, etc.

The water quality dataset hosted by AaS-GA was created through the volunteer efforts of many citizen scientists throughout the state over many years.
