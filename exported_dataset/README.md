# Exported dataset

The raw export sent from AaS-GA is the file "AAS_Chemical_Data_12202021.xlsx - Sheet1.csv".

It has been processed so far in two stages, resulting in the files "export_dataframe_stage1.csv" and similarly for #2. These files are provided via git's Large File System. If bandwidth has been exceeded for the month, the "large" data files (the largest are just a few MB) are mirrored on [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1czjUCDzNSZo3kzIlp4ET4kRqLhmnNm2j) and at [Sci4Ga](<tbd>), and the stages can be reproduced by running the notebooks.
